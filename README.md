"From Climate Talk to Stock Shock," by Allison Lin, Val Rogel, Aditya Jain.

**Abstract**

**Significant shifts have occurred in U.S. domestic climate policy since the ratification of the
2015 Paris Climate Accords. The efficient market hypothesis expresses that market prices
are driven by investor response to major shifts in news events and stories. Despite the
magnitude of these climate policy shifts, there is a lack of research on investor reactions to
such policy changes. In our study, we address this research gap by attempting to determine
and model the relationship between the sentiment of climate policy news headlines and the
financial metrics of major U.S. index funds. Initially, we employ the Valence Aware
Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) — a natural language processing (NLP)
technique — to derive sentiment scores from 14,000 relevant climate policy headlines
spanning January 2014 to June 2023. Following this, we apply Granger causality tests and
compare the effectiveness of univariate autoregressive forecasting models to bivariate
machine learning regression models. The latter incorporates climate policy news sentiment
as a predictive feature, allowing us to assess the value of this sentiment in forecasting index
fund metrics. Our findings indicate that consumer discretionary, consumer staples, and
information technology funds are most effectively predicted using climate policy news
sentiment. Through this study, we aim to illuminate the relationship between climate
policy news sentiment and shifts in investor behavior.
